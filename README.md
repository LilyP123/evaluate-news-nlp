# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is part of the Front End Developer Nanodegree program by Udacity. It demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of news articles.

The project uses the MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API to perform a sentiment analysis of a link added in the form text by a user. The API provides a score that represents the sentiment of the text, ranging from negative to positive.
